# PhantomChunks
PhantomChunks is a Minecraft Paper plugin that enables per-player virtual world layers within a single server. It supports dynamic chunk rendering, domain-specific block views, and a virtual height system that bypasses vanilla Y-limitations through seamless teleportation and chunk injection.
